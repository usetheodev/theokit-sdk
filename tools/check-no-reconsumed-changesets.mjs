/**
 * Refuse a release PR that would re-release work already shipped (B-109).
 *
 * `changesets/action` runs on `push: [main]`. It opens a "Version Packages" PR into `main`, and it
 * is THAT PR which consumes the `.changeset/*.md` files and bumps every `package.json`. Nothing
 * carries either back to `develop`, so `develop` falls one release further behind on every cut.
 *
 * The drift is not merely untidy. Measured on 2026-08-11, immediately before cutting a security
 * release: `develop` was 10 commits behind `main`, still declared `4.40.0` against main's `4.41.0`,
 * and still held three changesets that `4.41.0` had already consumed. Opening `develop → main` in
 * that state would have re-added all three, and the next `changeset version` would have re-released
 * three shipped features as fresh minors with duplicated CHANGELOG entries. A wrong version on npm
 * cannot be fixed — only deprecated.
 *
 * It was avoided that day only because someone happened to look. This script is what looks.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A changeset file is CONSUMED when a "Version Packages" merge deletes it from `main`. So for every
 * `.changeset/*.md` present on the PR head, ask git whether `main` has ever deleted that exact
 * path. If it has, the file is a resurrection of shipped work rather than a new change.
 *
 * This is a question about history, not about content, which is what makes it cheap and exact — no
 * parsing of changeset bodies, no guessing at which release absorbed what.
 *
 * A legitimate new change never trips it: `changeset add` generates a fresh random name, and a name
 * main has deleted is by definition one that already went out.
