/**
 * Release guard — refuse to report success for a release that published nothing.
 *
 * Ported from usetheokit/theokit's scripts/verify-release-published.mjs, per its own release.yml
 * comment claiming theokit-sdk "already records" this guard — it did not. Measured here 2026-09-03:
 * `Release via Changesets (Harness)` reported success on run 33786821826 while
 * `@theokit/sdk@5.0.0-next.2` never reached the registry (E404), git tag and GitHub release both
 * present. `verify-release-refs.mjs` in this same pipeline checks the tag; nothing checked npm.
 * Filed as usetheokit/theokit-sdk#537.
 *
 * ## The failure this exists to prevent
 *
 * A publish pipeline that reports success when it publishes nothing is indistinguishable from one
 * that published — until the day it matters. "Nothing to publish" (every version already on the
 * registry) and "published" produce the same visible outcome unless something checks the registry
 * directly, which nothing in this pipeline did before this file.
 *
 * ## What it proves, and what it does not
 *
 * It proves the versions this release was supposed to publish are ON the registry. It does not
 * prove the tarball's contents, the provenance attestation, or that the right account published —
 * a guard that claimed more than it measures is the failure mode this repository keeps finding.
 *
 * An unreachable registry FAILS rather than passing: "I could not check" and "it published" are
 * different facts, and only one of them is safe to report as a release.
 *
 * Usage: `node tools/verify-release-published.mjs`

 * The published size of a package, for backoff scaling. Large packages (>5MB) propagate slower

 *
 * Asked WITHOUT a version, and that is the whole point. This is only ever called for a version
 * the registry has just answered 404 for — that is what put it in `pending` — so asking for
 * `name@version` 404s for the same reason, the size comes back `undefined`, and the scaling this
 * function exists to drive never engages. It was unreachable by construction: in the loop below
 * it could not return anything else. Three releases (`5.0.0-next.2`, `.3`, `.4`) hit the default
 * 30s window and reported a false "was NOT published" with the mitigation supposedly in place.
 *
 * The bare name resolves the published `latest`, which by definition exists. Its size is a proxy
 * for the version being published, and a good one: measured 2026-09-04 on @theokit/sdk, `latest`
 * was 12_369_860 bytes against the pending version's 12_940_376 — 4% apart, and both land on the
 * same multiplier. A package with no published version at all still yields `undefined`, which is
 * the honest answer: nothing was measured, so nothing is scaled.

/**
 * npmjs is eventually consistent: a publish that has already succeeded can answer E404 on the read
 * path, and `npm view` reports that identically to a version nobody published. So `absent` is
 * retried before it is believed. `unknown` is not: an unreachable registry is an infrastructure
 * fault, and the honest response is to say so now rather than after minutes of waiting for a
 * network that is down.
 *
 * ## Why the ladder reaches 64 s (#574)
 *
 * "A few seconds" was the original estimate and it was wrong by an order of magnitude. Measured on
 * the `5.0.1` release, run 33971302112:
 *
 *   14:26:34  changeset: ◇ Successfully published @theokit/sdk@5.0.1, @theokit/sdk-memory@0.5.3
 *   14:28:03  this script: ✗ was NOT published, exit 1
 *   14:28:09  npm registers @theokit/sdk-memory@0.5.3   ← 6 s after we gave up
 *   14:29:36  npm registers @theokit/sdk@5.0.1          ← 93 s after we gave up
 *
 * Both were on the registry; `latest` moved to `5.0.1`. The publish had worked and this script
 * called it failed. `5.0.0` failed the same way the day before, on four packages — two of the last
 * twelve release runs were false failures.
 *
 * The old ladder `2000,4000,8000,16000` scaled by 2.6 for the 13 MB package gave it 78 s of budget
 * against 182 s of real lag. Adding `32000,64000` takes the scaled budget to 328 s, which covers
 * the measurement with margin.
 *
 * IT COSTS NOTHING ON A FAST RELEASE. Each step returns the moment the version appears, so the
 * extra rungs are only reached by a release that would otherwise have been reported as failed.
 *
 * WHAT WAS DELIBERATELY NOT DONE: softening the verdict to a warning. The reason this script exists
 * is #537 — a publish that silently did not happen, reported green. What was wrong here is the
 * budget, not the strictness, and a warning would trade a false failure for a false success.
