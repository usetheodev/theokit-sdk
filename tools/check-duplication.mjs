// Cross-package duplication ratchet — #295.
//
// The previous gate ran `jscpd packages/sdk/src`: one package out of fifteen. It
// reported 0 clones while 3,647 duplicated lines sat across the workspace, because
// every one of them is a copy that spans TWO packages and the scan only ever saw
// one side.
//
// What it was blind to, measured the day this was written:
//
//     283  sdk-memory/internal/index/index-manager.ts  ↔  sdk/internal/memory/index-manager.ts
//     262  sdk-memory/internal/index/lance-index.ts    ↔  sdk/internal/memory/lance-index.ts
//     242  sdk-memory/internal/active-memory/…         ↔  sdk/internal/memory/active-memory.ts
//     233  sdk-memory/internal/index/migrate-…         ↔  sdk/internal/memory/migrate-…
//     135  sdk-budget/internal/enforcement.ts          ↔  sdk/internal/budget/enforcement.ts
//
// This is not copy-paste, and it is not debt awaiting a cleanup. It is what the
// optional-peer architecture costs, decided deliberately (#306).
//
// `@theokit/sdk-budget` and `@theokit/sdk-memory` are OPTIONAL peers. sdk-core has
// to run budgets and memory with neither installed, so it needs its own working
// implementation — that is the fallback which makes the peer optional in the first
// place. The satellite needs its own to be independently richer and replaceable
// through the `BudgetTracker` / `MemoryProvider` ports.
//
// They are not collapsible by re-export, and this was tried rather than assumed:
// deleting sdk-budget's copies and re-exporting the same symbols from `@theokit/sdk`
// failed two tests immediately. The copies read identically and bind to DIFFERENT
// module-level state — each imports its own package's `./ledger.js` and
// `./registry.js`. Two ledgers, not one implementation written twice.
//
// So the number here is a CEILING, not a target. It stops a genuinely accidental
// copy from landing, which is the failure this gate exists to catch, while the
// structural overlap sits below it untouched.
//
// Raising BUDGET needs a reason in the commit message: the architecture explains
// the figure that is here, not any figure. Lower it if a real consolidation ever
// lands — the gate prints the new number when it drops.
