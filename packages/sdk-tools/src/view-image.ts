/**
 * `view_image` — let the agent LOOK at an image in the project.
 *
 * ## Why this is a built-in
 *
 * It was the one tool a consumer had to write from scratch (89 LOC), and its shape — a `handler`
 * returning a structured result plus `toModelOutput` shaping it into an `ImageBlock` — is the
 * canonical multimodal shape the SDK already defines (SE17). Every product that wants an agent to look at a
 * screenshot rewrites the same base64 + media-type + confinement logic.
 *
 * The confinement is the part that is easy to get wrong, and the reason this belongs in a reviewed
 * built-in rather than in each product: **an image reader that honours any path is a file
 * exfiltration primitive with a friendly name.** `/etc/passwd` renamed to `.png` is not a
 * hypothetical — it is one prompt away.
 *
 * ## The two channels
 *
 * This built-in uses the SE17 split. The handler returns the envelope as a JSON **string** — which
 * is what `Tool.create` types it to return — and `toModelOutput` turns that string into an
 * `ImageBlock` for the model, while `defineTool` routes the full value to `onToolEnd` through a
 * resolver under `TOOL_SPLIT_RESOLVER`.
 *
 * So `tool.handler(...)` yields image blocks on success and the JSON string on failure: the factory
 * has already applied the shaping. There is no `tool.toModelOutput` left to call, and returning the
 * envelope unshaped would send the model a base64 blob as TEXT — something it cannot look at, which
 * is the failure this tool exists to avoid.
 *
 * ## Result shape (the APP channel)
 *
 *   - `{ ok: true, path, media_type, bytes, data }`
 *   - `{ ok: false, error: "path_traversal" | "not_found" | "unsupported_image_type" | "image_too_large", … }`
