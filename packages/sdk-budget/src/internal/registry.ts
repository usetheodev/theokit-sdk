 *
 * Registering does NOT reset spend. The ledger is keyed by NAME and outlives the registry entry, so
 * re-creating a budget after `deleteBudget` inherits everything charged under that name — a
 * config reload keeps enforcing the day's spend, which is usually right and is a surprise if you
 * expected a fresh start.
