 * `InvalidAgentError` before a single byte of protocol is read. `serveAcp` is `async`, so that
 * arrives as a REJECTED PROMISE, never as a synchronous throw — `try { serveAcp(...) } catch` around
 * the call alone catches nothing. The class is not exported either (see {@link serveAcp}); match on

 *   failure, or `permissionTimeoutMs` elapsing all BLOCK the call.
 * - `"auto"` — no gating whatsoever: the veto plugin is never installed, so `trustedTools` AND
 *   `permissionTimeoutMs` are silently ignored in this mode.
 * - `"deny"` — blocks every tool call without asking the host. `trustedTools` does NOT exempt
 *   anything here: the deny branch is evaluated before the trusted-tool check.
 *
 * `"ask"` and `"deny"` fail closed. When the runtime has no plugin manager to hang the veto on (a
 * cloud-backed agent, for instance), the prompt is refused with `-32603` rather than executed
 * ungated — a security control that cannot be installed must not silently degrade to `"auto"`.
