/**
 * Record what a build actually wired, as opposed to what configuration asked for.
 *
 * A product that reads a project directory decides, while building, which of that directory's
 * entities it will honour: MCP servers, skills, hook events, commands. When a trust posture withholds
 * them, the build simply proceeds with fewer — and every surface that later asks "what is loaded?"
 * sees an empty list. Empty because nothing was configured and empty because everything was withheld
 * are the same emptiness to the reader, and only one of them is something they can act on.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a re-read
 *
 * The obvious implementation of any "what is loaded?" listing is to read the configuration again.
 * That is the defect this exists to prevent: a re-read cannot detect a disagreement between what
 * config asked for and what the build did, because it IS the config. The two disagree exactly when
 * something suppressed an entity, which is the case worth reporting.
 *
 * So this function is pure and parameterized. It performs no I/O, which is what makes "no second
 * read" checkable rather than promised — the caller passes the values it handed to the builder, at
 * the moment it handed them over, and what comes back is an observation of that moment.
 *
 * ## What is generic here, and what is not
 *
 * The RULE is generic: for each capability, active is the request when allowed and empty when not,
 * and suppression is only claimed when something was actually removed. The VOCABULARY is not —
 * which capabilities exist and what the entities are called belong to the product, and arrive as
 * data.
