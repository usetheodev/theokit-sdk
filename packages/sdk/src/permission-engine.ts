 * the narrow rules first: a catch-all `tool` RegExp placed above a specific deny makes that deny
 * unreachable, and nothing warns you.
 *
 * `args` is what lets one tool name resolve differently depending on what it is asked to do —

 * That was not always true, and the fix is the reason this paragraph is explicit (#367). A predicate
 * used to be called anyway, so `(v) => v !== "prod"` returned true for a missing argument and an
 * ALLOW rule authorized a call that supplied nothing, while `(v) => v.includes("rm")` threw a
 * TypeError out of the permission gate. This docblock told consumers to guard every predicate by
 * hand for months after `argMatches` stopped needing it — you do not have to.

/**
 * Ordered first-match permission rules for tool invocations — the policy object you hand to

 *
 * On its own it enforces nothing. `evaluate(toolName, args, mode)` is a pure function returning
 * `"allow" | "deny" | "ask"`, and no part of the SDK calls it until the engine is wrapped in a plugin
 * and that plugin is registered on an agent. The plugin is where a verdict becomes behaviour: `deny`
 * blocks the tool call, `allow` passes it through, and `ask` is routed to the host's `canUseTool`
 * gate — with no gate configured, `ask` blocks. So constructing an engine and never registering it
 * is a policy that does nothing, which is the mistake worth knowing about first.
 *
 * It is fail-closed by default: a call no rule matches resolves to `"ask"`, not `"allow"`, so a tool
 * the rules never mention needs a human — or an explicit `{ defaultAction: "allow" }` — before it
 * runs. Keep that default if you intend to use `PermissionMode: "plan"` for read-only behaviour,
 * because `plan` gates on the RESOLVED verdict: an engine built with `defaultAction: "allow"` still
 * allows every unmatched call under `plan`.
 *
 * The rules array is stored by reference and walked afresh on every `evaluate` call. Mutating the
 * array you passed in therefore changes the policy of a live engine; build a new engine when you
 * want a policy change to be a deliberate, visible event.
