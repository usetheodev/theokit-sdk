 * The execution capability handed to an agent tool, and the extension point for new environments.

 * `grep` and `ls`, so a subclass that overrides `execute` alone inherits confined reads, searches and
 * listings for free. It does not inherit confined writes: `writeFile` delegates to `uploadFile`, and
 * that is the second override `LinuxSandbox` needs.
 *
 * Choosing one: `LocalSandbox` runs the command on the host with no isolation and suits code you
 * already trust; `LinuxSandbox` adds kernel confinement where bubblewrap is available;
 * `createSandboxBackend` probes and picks between them, and is the right entry point unless you have
 * a reason to pin one. For genuinely untrusted code you want a container or VM backend, which this
 * package does not ship — write it against these two methods.
 *
 * Because the derived helpers assemble shell command lines (arguments escaped for POSIX `sh`), a
 * backend whose `execute` is not a POSIX shell must override them as well.
