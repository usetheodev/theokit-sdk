// M75 T2.2 — the backend with kernel enforcement + the wrap + the posture. `wrapCommandForSandbox` is

// wrap elsewhere (the interactive PTY), the second so the UI can answer "am I confined right now?".
// The two warn-latch resets are test seams that were re-exported here under plain camelCase, reading
// like ordinary API. They are `__…ForTests` at their definitions now, matching the 22 sibling seams in
// this package, and tests import them by explicit module path — the convention `internal/security/
// redact.ts` states: "NOT included in the index.ts barrel ... to discourage production callers".
//
// The old names stay as deprecated aliases rather than disappearing, because this is a published
// sub-path and removing an export is a major-version decision, not a cleanup. `resetBwrapMemo` is
// NOT here: it is genuinely public, being the only way to make a memoized bwrap probe re-run.
