 * timeouts and the `ExecuteResult` shape are all inherited, so confinement is a change to the argv
 * and never an in-process one.
 *
 * Prefer `createSandboxBackend` over constructing this directly. The class assumes bubblewrap is
 * present and never probes for it, so on a host without it every command comes back failed rather
 * than confined; the factory probes first and degrades to a plain `LocalSandbox` with a warning.
 *
 * What the confinement actually covers: the filesystem is bound read-only in full, and
 * `mode: "workspace-write"` adds the workspace root plus `/tmp` as the only writable paths, while
 * `"read-only"` adds none. The network is unshared unless `network: true`. The environment is cleared
 * and repopulated from {@link allowlistedEnv} unless an explicit `env` is passed. The seccomp syscall
 * filter is a second stage with two conditions on it — x86_64 only, and only when the network is
 * restricted — so `network: true` gives you bwrap's filesystem confinement and no syscall filter.
 * `mode: "danger-full-access"` skips the wrap entirely and this class behaves as plain
 * `LocalSandbox`.
 *
 * `uploadFile` is overridden so that writes go through the confined `execute` (base64 over stdin,
 * keeping arbitrary content out of the shell command line). A write the policy forbids therefore
 * fails, throwing a plain `Error` naming the target path and the stderr, instead of quietly landing
