/**
 * LocalSandbox — subprocess-based execution. **This is NOT an isolation
 * boundary.** It runs the command via `/bin/sh -c` in the SAME OS as the host
 * with the host's filesystem and network fully reachable — it provides NO
 * process, filesystem, or network isolation. Its only safety affordances are:
 *   - a wall-clock timeout (kills a runaway command),
 *   - an output-size cap (bounds memory), and
 *   - env scrubbing (#54): secret-like parent env vars (`*KEY*`/`*SECRET*`/
 *     `*TOKEN*`/`*PASSWORD*`/`*_AUTH*`) are dropped from the child by default
 *     (`SandboxConfig.env`), so a shell tool cannot exfiltrate host secrets via
 *     the environment.
 *
 * For real isolation (untrusted code), use a container/VM backend — NOT this.

/**
 * Runs a command with `/bin/sh -c` on the host. NOT an isolation boundary — the
 * module note above states exactly what it does and does not protect.
 *
 *   const sandbox = new LocalSandbox({ workDir: "/srv/repo", timeoutMs: 10_000 });
 *   const { stdout, exitCode, timedOut } = await sandbox.execute("ls -1");
 *
 * Needs a POSIX host with `/bin/sh`. Every helper inherited from
 * {@link SandboxBackend} — `readFile`, `glob`, `grep`, `listDir` — is built on
 * this `execute`, so they inherit that requirement too.
 *
 * How it fails: `execute` NEVER rejects. Every outcome, including a failure to
 * spawn, comes back as an {@link ExecuteResult}; read `timedOut` first
 * (`true` implies `exitCode` 124) and `stderr` for the reason. `uploadFile` DOES
 * reject, with the raw `node:fs` error, on a bad path or missing permission.
 *
 * Traps:
 *  - `exitCode` is not the child's exit code. It is 0, 124 (timed out) or 1 — a
 *    command that exits 3 is reported as 1, so branching on a specific code does
 *    not work here.
 *  - Output beyond `maxOutputBytes` (default 5 MiB) makes Node kill the child.
 *    The result is `exitCode: 1` and `timedOut: false`, with the cut stream
 *    carrying the `...(truncated)` marker described on `ExecuteResult` (#363).
 *    Since `exitCode` is 1 either way, that marker is what tells a lost-output
 *    result from a command that genuinely failed.
 *  - `uploadFile` resolves a relative path against `workDir` but does not contain
 *    it: an absolute path, or one containing `..`, writes wherever the process
 *    can. `workDir` is a starting directory, not a jail.
 *  - Secret-like parent env vars are dropped by default. Passing
 *    `env: "all"` in {@link SandboxConfig} puts the host's API keys back within
 *    reach of any command the agent runs.
