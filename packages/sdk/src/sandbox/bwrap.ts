 * HONEST SCOPE: filesystem confinement + network isolation via bwrap, PLUS the second stage —
 * a cBPF seccomp syscall filter (`agents/sandbox/seccomp.ts`), wired in `agents/sandbox/backend.ts`
 * via `restrictedSeccompPath()`. Ported in M63; this block claimed the opposite until M67 and
 * UNDER-DECLARED the real security posture. The honest limit that remains: the filter is **x86_64**
 * (an architecture guard refuses to install it on any other arch, with a WARN, and bwrap's FS/network
 * confinement still applies) **and** it is only installed when the network is restricted
 * (`backend.ts:87`, faithful to `landlock.rs:96-117`): with the network on there is no syscall
 * filter, only bwrap's FS confinement. `danger-full-access` skips bwrap entirely, mirroring
 * `bwrap.rs:245-252`. Deltas versus Codex remain documented in docs/CODEX-PARITY.md.

/**
 * The probe result, memoized for the lifetime of the PROCESS.
 *
 * Measured before M71: `detectBwrap()` costs **22.2 ms** and was not memoized — the second call
 * cost 19.4 ms. `buildChatAgent` on the headless path fired **two** (one from
 * `createSandboxBackend`, another from `resolveSandboxPosture`, which M70 added), totalling 46.4 ms
 * per construction — and construction happens per turn. Under `strace`, ~90% of the 182 syscalls of
 * an already-warm construction came from here: `which` sweeping the PATH, `/proc/filesystems`,
 * `/newroot`, and the `.so` files the two probe subprocesses load.
 *
 * ## Why there is no invalidation
 *
 * The milestone called for invalidating on `SessionStart`. That does not work:
 * `agents/lib/hooks/hooks.ts:28-30` documents — as a **measured** correction of an earlier
 * assumption — that the event fires **once per TURN**, not per session. Invalidating there would
 * re-probe every turn, exactly the behavior memoization exists to eliminate.
 *
 * A write-once cache is sufficient here: the expensive probe runs once per process,
 * only to print a UI warning.
 *
 * **The price, stated plainly — in BOTH directions.** The original m71-cost-per-turn#ADR-1 declared
 * only one of them; the M71 review (F-perf-9) showed the omitted one was precisely the one with a
 * security consequence:
 *
 * - **Stale negative** (`bwrap` installed AFTERWARDS): not detected until restart. The system fails
 *   CLOSED — the posture reports `enforced: false` and M70's veto **refuses**. Cost: annoyance (the
 *   message tells you to install the bwrap you just installed). Accepted.
 * - **Stale positive** (`bwrap` removed/renamed AFTERWARDS): the posture would keep asserting
 *   `enforced: true / "kernel (bwrap)"` and the veto would **approve**, citing a confinement that no
 *   longer exists. That is the literal reintroduction of the defect M70 fixed — *"telling the
 *   operator they are protected when they are not is worse than saying nothing"*. Before M71 the
 *   per-turn re-probe closed that window on the next turn; memoization would leave it open for the
 *   whole process. **That is why the positive is revalidated** below, at 1 syscall — 3 orders of
 *   magnitude below the 22.2 ms of the full probe, which is the cost memoization exists to remove.
