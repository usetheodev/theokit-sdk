/**
 * `@theokit/sdk/auth` — the M42 auth subsystem: a hardened credential store (`api|oauth` discriminated
 * union, atomic O_EXCL + rename + fsync write at 0600, 0700/0600 mode gates) plus an OAuth engine (RFC 8628
 * device grant, OpenAI two-step headless flow, token exchange + transparent refresh with in-flight-refresh
 * coalescing). Generalized to `provider: string` + a caller-supplied `CredentialStoreConfig` — no hardcoded
 * client IDs. `resolveCredential(name)` returns a fresh (auto-refreshed) `ResolvedCredential`; an oauth
 * provider composes it into its `ProviderProfile.transform.fetch` so the router obtains the fresh bearer at
 * stream time.
 *
 * Exposed as a dedicated sub-entry (DTS built via tsc) — the same isolation the SDK uses for `messages` /
 * `subscription` / `sanitize`, because rollup-plugin-dts cannot bundle these modules into the main barrel.
 *
 * @packageDocumentation

/**
 * "Which provider issued this key?" — the question a login flow asks before any profile exists.
 *
 * Made REACHABLE rather than written: the SDK already answered it, from a module no entry point
 * exported, and a measured consumer wrote its own copy because it could not import ours. The lookup
 * now derives its longest-first ordering instead of depending on the order the table happens to be
 * typed in.
 *
 * NOTE — do not name the internal-visibility tag in this docblock. `tsconfig.base.json` sets
 * `stripInternal: true`, and TypeScript matches the tag anywhere in an attached JSDoc, prose
 * included. Mentioning it here deleted this very line from `dist/auth/index.d.ts`: the symbol
 * shipped at runtime and could not be imported with types — the exact defect this export exists to
 * fix, reintroduced by the comment explaining the fix (usetheodev/theokit-sdk#283).
