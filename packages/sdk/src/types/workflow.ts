 * The cost is stated rather than hidden: `isTransientError(err)` is `false` for this class, so a
 * parallel step whose branches failed transiently is not retried by the SDK's own helper. Inspect
 * `err.errors` and decide per branch — which is what an aggregate asks of a caller anyway, since
 * "should this be retried" has no single answer when the branches failed for different reasons.
