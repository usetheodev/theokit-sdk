 * `BudgetTracker` — runtime contract for budget/usage tracking in the
 * agent loop (SDK 2.0 Phase 2 / T2.1 — ADR D1 interface inversion).
 *
 * This interface is the FOUNDATION for the eventual extraction of the
 * Budget subsystem to `@theokit/sdk-budget`. The kernel depends on this
 * contract (not on `UsageAccumulator` / `IterationBudget` concrete classes)
 * so the implementation can move to a separate package without circular
 * imports.
 *
 * DIP-correct home (SE46): the contract types live in the domain `types/`
 * layer; the application-layer implementation
 * (`internal/budget/tracker/budget-tracker.ts`) re-exports them for
 * back-compat while owning the concrete trackers.
 *
 * @public — surface-level interface; impl is internal-but-replaceable.
