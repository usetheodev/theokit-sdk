/**
 * Subagent delegation — declarative child agent invocable as a tool.
 *
 * Per ADR D2: `defineSubAgent(spec)` returns a `CustomTool` that, when
 * invoked by the LLM, creates a child agent and sends the input as a
 * message. EC-2: delegation depth is tracked across the RUN (#364) — each
 * delegation publishes its depth on the async scope its child executes in, so a
 * subagent that delegates to a subagent is bounded by `maxDelegationDepth`
 * without the caller threading a counter by hand.
 *
 * SE10 — the handler forwards the parent run's `AbortSignal` to the child.
 * SE11 — optional `onDelegationStart` / `onDelegationComplete` lifecycle hooks
 * let the caller reject, rewrite, observe, or annotate a delegation.

 *
 * What the child inherits from the parent AT DISPATCH TIME, not from this object:
 * the API key, the model (unless `model` is set), the parent's plugins, and the
 * parent's sandbox posture (unless `sandbox` is set). An absent `sandbox` inherits;
 * an explicit `sandbox: false` turns confinement OFF for a child of a confined
 * parent, which is not the same thing.
 *
 * How it fails: the child's failure is re-thrown to the supervisor as a tool error
 * — a run ending in `status: "error"` becomes
 * `subagent "<name>" run failed: <cause>`. `onDelegationStart` and `messageFilter`
 * propagate their own throws; only a throw from `onDelegationComplete` ON THE
 * ERROR PATH is suppressed, so it cannot mask the real cause.
 *
 * Traps:
 *  - `model` as a bare string drops reasoning parameters. Pass the
 *    {@link ModelSelection} object form when the child needs `params`.
 *  - `maxDelegationDepth` (default 3) bounds the delegation CHAIN, counted at
 *    dispatch across the run (#364) — the depth is not something you thread. The
 *    `parentDepth` argument of `SubAgent.create` still offsets it, for a supervisor
 *    that wants a lower ceiling than the chain it sits in.
 *  - Context isolation is the DEFAULT. Without `messageFilter` the child sees only
 *    the delegated string; without `includeToolResults` the supervisor gets only
 *    the child's final text.

 * attach them to the tool, and any layer that rebuilt that object dropped them —
 * including the SDK's own rebuild (theokit#148). Credentials now ride the
 * dispatch, so a rebuilt tool cannot lose them. `def.model` overrides the model
 * (`"inherit"` keeps the parent's), and `def.tools` scopes the child to that
 * subset of the parent's tools (absent → the parent's full toolset, per the
 * `AgentDefinition.tools` contract).
 *
 * M33 — per-subagent `model` (with reasoning `params`) and `sandbox` are now wired
 * into local delegation: each is carried onto the {@link SubAgentSpec} and applied to
 * the child in {@link buildChildCreateOptions}. `"inherit"` (or an absent field) keeps
 * the parent's value. Per-subagent `mcp` is rejected at load (see subagents-loader) —
 * resolving server names→config on the local path is a follow-up.
