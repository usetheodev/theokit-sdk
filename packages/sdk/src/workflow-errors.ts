/**
 * The workflow error hierarchy — runtime classes, deliberately NOT in `types/`.

 * `types/index.ts` calls itself "the canonical public contract" and re-exports every sibling with
 * `export type *`, which cannot carry a value; `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` restates the same rule as
 * "src/types/* are pure type definitions". These twelve classes lived in `types/workflow.ts` anyway
 * and reached consumers only because the DTS rollup hoists a declaration the runtime bundle never
 * emitted — the shape that shipped #279 for `isValidTaskId`. `tests/lint/types-are-types-only.test.ts`
 * is what stops it recurring.
 *
 * The home mirrors `task-errors.ts`: errors for one public surface, next to it, at the src root.
 * Re-exported by name from `workflow.ts`, so `@theokit/sdk/workflow` is unchanged.
