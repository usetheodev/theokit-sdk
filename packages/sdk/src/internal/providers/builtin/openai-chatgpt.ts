 * M43 — the ChatGPT "Codex" backend as a first-class builtin `ProviderProfile`. Migrated from the

 * `openai-chatgpt/<model>` and logs in — ZERO provider logic in the consumer.
 *
 * The provider-auth model (see the codex-provider-in-sdk blueprint):
 * - static profile + a `transform.fetch` that resolves the LIVE credential per HTTP request (fresh Bearer +
 *   dynamic `ChatGPT-Account-Id`), so a mid-turn expiry refreshes transparently with NO agent rebuild;
 * - the protocol values (endpoint, models, oauth config, `originator` header) are SDK-owned constants.
