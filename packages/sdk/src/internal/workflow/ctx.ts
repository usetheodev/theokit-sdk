 * close, in the words of `internal/diagnostics.ts`: "those writes interleave with the render and
 * CORRUPT THE FRAME" in a TUI host. `step-branch.ts`, in this same folder, was converted in that
 * sweep and routes its predicate warning through `diag`.
 *
 * `diagnostics.ts` allowlists "the Workflow logger" as a seam whose destination the CALLER chooses.
 * Measured before changing this: it does not. `types/workflow.ts` declares no logger option, and
 * `StepContext.log` is constructed here with no injection point, so a consumer had no way to
 * redirect it. The exemption described something that was never built.
 *
 * The level is formatted into the message rather than becoming a channel, matching the other
 * converted sites — `diag` is deliberately not a logger with levels, and inventing one here would be
 * the requirement nobody asked for that its own docblock warns against.
