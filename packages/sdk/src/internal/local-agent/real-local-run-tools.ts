 * Precedence for the custom half (matches the mcpServers semantics — "fully replaces, not merged"):
 *  - `sendOptions.tools === undefined` → fall back to `agentOptions.tools`
 *  - `sendOptions.tools = []`         → explicitly clear (no custom tools)
 *  - `sendOptions.tools = [t1, ...]`  → use exactly these for this run
 *
 * usetheokit/theokit-sdk#381 added the builtin half, and it is why this is no longer named for
 * custom tools alone. It rides here rather than at the call site because the withhold list is
 * part of the same answer — what this run declares to the model — and because a run that
 * withholds nothing must produce the same `AgentLoopInputs` it produced before the option existed,
 * which is easiest to guarantee where the rest of the catalog is already assembled.
 *
 * Note the two halves are independent: an agent with no custom tools at all can still withhold a
 * builtin, so the "no tools" early return carries the withhold list out with it.
 *
 * ONE options record rather than eight positional parameters. Five of the eight were optional or
 * nullable in adjacent slots — `ReadonlyArray<string> | undefined`, `string`, `string | undefined`,
 * `Record | undefined`, `ModelSelection | undefined` — compatible enough that transposing two of
 * them compiled. The single call site was already destructuring the same `CreateRealLocalRunOptions`
 * value field by field, so the parameter list was re-deriving a record the caller held.
