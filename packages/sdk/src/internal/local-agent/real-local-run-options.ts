/**
 * What one local run is built from.
 *
 * Its own module because `real-local-run.ts` and the two files split out of it —
 * `real-local-run-provider.ts` and `real-local-run-mcp.ts` — all take it, and having any of them own
 * it makes the other two import back into it. madge caught exactly that: the first version of the
 * split put the interface in `real-local-run.ts` and produced a `provider -> run -> provider` pair.
 *
 * A type-only cycle erases at compile and breaks no build, but it is the same design statement in
 * the wrong direction as any other, and this repo has a rule about it (`.dependency-cruiser.cjs`
 * G7a, and `types/agent-prims.ts`, which exists for the identical reason).
 *
 *
 * `SessionMessage` comes from `types/session-message.ts` and NOT from the `internal/session/` barrel:
 * that barrel reaches back here through `compact-session.ts`, and madge reported the loop the moment
 * this file existed. Importing the declaring module instead of the barrel is the cheaper half of the
 * same lesson `types/agent-prims.ts` records.
 *
 * NAMED `-options` RATHER THAN `-types`: `tests/lint/types-module-naming.test.ts` refuses a
 * `X-types.ts` in a folder with no bare `types.ts` to distinguish it from, on the grounds that the
 * prefix then carries no information. The gate caught this file on its first commit, which is what
 * it is for.
