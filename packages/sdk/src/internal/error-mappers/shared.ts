/**
 * The HTTP status ladder — ONE definition, shared by every provider mapper.
 *
 * This is RFC 9110 semantics, not a vendor contract: a 429 means the same thing
 * whether Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock or Vertex sent it. It lived in four copies
 * until 2026-09-01 and the copies had already drifted in two measurable ways,
 * which is what moved it here beside the other dialect-agnostic helpers ADR D67
 * extracted:
 *
 *  1. **402 reached one mapper of four.** T3.7 added `quota_exceeded` and wired
 *     it into `openai-compatible.ts` only. A Bedrock, Vertex or Anthropic
 *     endpoint answering 402 fell through every arm and came back `unknown` —
 *     the canonical bucket existed and three of four mappers could not reach it.
 *  2. **The 5xx arm had two different upper bounds.** `anthropic` and
 *     `openai-compatible` guarded `>= 500 && < 600`; `bedrock` and `vertex`
 *     guarded `>= 500` with no ceiling, so a malformed or proxy-injected 6xx was
 *     `server_error` in two mappers and `unknown` in the other two.
 *
 * Neither was a vendor difference. Both were copy-drift, and that is the DRY
 * test in its textbook form: one piece of knowledge, four places to change it.
 *
 * The ladder is deliberately the FALLBACK, never the whole classifier. Each
 * mapper keeps its own body-dialect rules — Anthropic's `context_too_long`,
 * Bedrock's AWS `__type` strings, Vertex's `google.rpc` status enum — because
 * those ARE per-vendor contracts. The shape is
 * `classifyVendorBody(body) ?? httpStatusToErrorCode(status)`.
 *
 * 404 is deliberately NOT mapped here. Three mappers treat it as `unknown` and
 * Bedrock treats it as `invalid_request` via its own `__type` rules; folding it
 * in would silently change three mappers to close a divergence nobody measured.
