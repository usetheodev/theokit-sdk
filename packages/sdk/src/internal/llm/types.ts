 * Semver-exempt: nothing here is declared in `package.json` `exports`. These types are nonetheless
 * reachable from published declarations through the type graph, so they must be EMITTED.

 * and TypeScript scans EVERY leading comment range of the declaration that follows. The tag that
 * used to sit here deleted `LlmTool` from the emitted `.d.ts` while `LlmRequest`, which names it,
 * survived — a declaration that does not compile for any consumer running type-aware lint.
