/**
 * M42 — shared auth contract types. A LEAF module: pure type declarations, NO runtime imports (no zod, no
 * node:fs). Every auth module (`credential-store`, `oauth-engine`, `oauth-device`, `resolve-credential`)
 * imports its cross-module types from here so the barrel's rollup-plugin-dts bundle sees a single canonical
 * origin — the codebase's established "leaf-type-only deps" pattern (see tsup.config.ts), which sidesteps
 * the rollup-dts cross-module resolution limitation that a value-module type export trips.
 *
 * Every type here is re-exported from `@theokit/sdk/auth` and is therefore PUBLIC, under semver.
 *
 * This block sits directly above `CredentialStoreConfig` with no statement between them, so it is
 * one of that declaration's leading comment ranges — an internal-visibility tag written here is
 * scanned by `stripInternal` and deletes the interface from the emitted `.d.ts`. That is exactly
 * what happened, and it is the same trap recorded in `src/auth/index.ts`
 * (usetheodev/theokit-sdk#283). Do not name that tag anywhere in this file.

/**
 * Where the credential store lives — the three path segments, plus an optional environment
 * override.
 *
 * The store directory is `join(home, dirName)` and the file is `fileName` inside it. When
 * `homeEnvVar` is set AND the caller's `env` map holds that variable non-blank, its trimmed value
 * REPLACES the whole directory: `dirName` is not appended to it, mirroring how `CODEX_HOME` works.
 * A blank or absent variable falls back to `join(home, dirName)`.
 *
 * `env` is always a parameter on the functions that take this config, never an ambient
 * `process.env` read, and it defaults to an empty map — so a caller that forgets to pass it gets
 * the non-overridden path rather than whatever the process happens to have.
 *
 * Nothing here is validated or created. A relative `home` stays relative to the process cwd, and
 * the directory is created on first write, at mode 0700.
 *
 * The store this addresses holds live credentials in plaintext, so `dirName` should be a directory
 * the SDK owns rather than one shared with unrelated state: reads enforce 0700 on the directory
 * and 0600 on the file, and refuse when either is looser.

 * mode 0600 inside a 0700 directory, and `readAuthFile` refuses to read a file readable by other
 * users or a directory writable by them. On Windows that gate is skipped entirely, because the
 * mode bits Node reports there do not describe the real ACLs.
 *
 * `type` and `provider` are both optional so that a legacy file written before the union existed
 * — a bare `{ "provider": ..., "api_key": ... }` — still parses as this variant with no
 * migration. `type` is never written: the api variant is persisted without the discriminant, and

 * durable of the two — an expired `access` is worth little, a leaked `refresh` mints new ones —
 * and it is why `readStoredOAuth` is the only path that hands this shape out: the resolved
 * credential every other consumer sees carries the access token and nothing else.
 *
 * `type: "oauth"` is the discriminant and is always written; a file without it reads back as the
 * API-key variant. `provider`, `access` and `refresh` must be non-empty — `writeCredential`
 * refuses an empty access or refresh token, and the read schema rejects empty strings.
