/**
 * Goal-driven Ralph loop (T3.2, ADRs D115-D121).
 *
 * `runUntilImpl` is an `AsyncGenerator<GoalEvent, GoalResult, void>`:
 * yields events as the loop progresses, returns the final result when
 * the goal completes, fails, or is paused. The auxiliary judge model is
 * injected via `deps.judge` so the generator stays free of the `Agent`
 * façade import.
 *
 * EC-C fix: pre-aborted signals emit only `[paused]`, not `[active, paused]`.
 * EC-D: `maxTurns: 0` is supported (vacuous yield active → failed).
