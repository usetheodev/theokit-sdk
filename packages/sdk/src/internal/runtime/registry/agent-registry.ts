/**
 * The registered agents, optionally narrowed by runtime and by workspace `cwd`.

 * ## M107 — why `cwd` is a parameter here and not a filter at the call site
 *
 * The in-memory Map is process-wide, so hydrating a foreign `cwd` pours its entries into the SAME
 * Map that a later un-narrowed listing reads. Without this filter, listing project A would make
 * project B "own" A's sessions — and the consumer feeds that list into `activeKnown`, one of the
 * NEVER-delete guards on a path that calls `unlink`.
 *
 * The narrowing uses {@link resolveRegistryCwd}, NOT `agent.cwd === cwd`, and that is the whole
 * point: `cwd` is optional on a registered agent, and its absence ALREADY means `process.cwd()` for
 * the purposes of routing the entry to a file on disk. A naive equality check would drop every
 * cwd-less entry from the listing of its own project — an entry missing from `activeKnown` is an
 * entry the collector stops protecting. Filter and persistence must answer "which project owns
 * this?" the same way, or they are two oracles over one fact.
