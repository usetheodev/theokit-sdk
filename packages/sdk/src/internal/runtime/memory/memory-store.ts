 * fact. What was missing is the SIGNAL. `persistMemoryFactIfWritePrompt` had three early returns
 * and a diagnostic on none of them, so a phrase one token from the supported one — `Remember,
 * please:`, `Remember that:` — answered normally and stored nothing, and the caller could only find
 * out by listing the store.
 *
 * The transcript indexer is what made it expensive. The sentence still lands in `sessions/run-*.md`
 * and is indexed, so a follow-up question comes back with the right answer and the developer
 * concludes memory is on. What they have is full-text search over transcripts: no `MEMORY.md`,
 * nothing to commit, nothing a human can edit, nothing that survives transcript pruning.
 *
 * **The supported forms are interpolated from {@link MEMORY_KINDS}, never spelled out.** The
 * reported defect IS the accepted vocabulary changing between 4.56.0 and 4.57.0 with nothing
 * announcing it; a hand-written list here would be a second place for that vocabulary to live and
 * could go stale exactly the same way, one layer up from the bug it explains.
 *
 * Returns a string rather than emitting one, in the shape {@link indexBudgetWarning} established:
 * the caller decides where it goes, and a pure function is testable without a captured stderr.
