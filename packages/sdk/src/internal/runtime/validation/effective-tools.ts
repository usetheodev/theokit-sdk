/**
 * #583 — what tool names an agent built from these options will actually offer the model.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * `Agent.describe()` was the only reflection surface, and it builds its catalog as
 * `(agent.options.tools ?? [])` — literally the array the caller passed. The SDK's own builtins were
 * never in it. So the two states that matter most were indistinguishable:
 *
 *     Agent.create({ tools: [] })                       describe().tools = []   (holds a shell)
 *     the same, withheldBuiltinTools: ["shell"]         describe().tools = []   (holds nothing)
 *
 * A consumer trying to confirm that a role declared read-only really is one had no instrument. What
 * they had to do instead — measured, in a real session — was ask the agent to enumerate its own
 * catalog: needs a credential, needs the network, and returns the list the MODEL decided to write
 * rather than the one the runtime holds. The same session recorded a subagent answering *"I can't
 * run shell commands in this environment"* while its catalog listed `shell`. An attempt measures the
 * model's disposition; the catalog measures its authority.
 *
 * ## Why it takes options rather than an agent id
 *
 * The asked-for shape, and it is the right one: synchronous, credential-free, and answerable BEFORE
 * the agent runs — so a test can compare what it declared against what the runtime will declare.
 * `describe()` needs a registered agent and answers too late for that.
 *
 * ## Why it does not return a bare array
 *
 * Because a bare array reads as complete, and completeness is exactly what this cannot promise: MCP
 * tools need a live connection, plugin tools and the reasoning `think` tool are assembled per run.
 * Returning `string[]` would rebuild the defect one function over. `unresolved` names the sources
 * that were configured and could not be enumerated — and is EMPTY when none were, which is when the
 * list is genuinely the whole catalog.
 *
