/**
 * Every SQL string the memory index runs, in one place.
 *
 * `IndexManager` answered four questions with four independent reasons to change: the corpus walk,
 * the BM25-to-score normalisation, the vector-cache strategy, and the schema. This is the fourth.
 * Changing a column, an index or a join is now a change to THIS file, and the caller above it reads
 * as search logic rather than as SQL with scoring in between.
 *
 * The row-to-`MemorySearchHit` mapping deliberately stays with the caller: turning a row into a hit
 * involves a score, a snippet and a citation, none of which the schema knows about. Keeping it here
 * would move the normalisation into the repository and re-create the same mixture one layer down.
 *
 * Rows come back as `Record<string, unknown>` for the same reason: the repository knows what it
 * SELECTed, not what the caller will make of it.
