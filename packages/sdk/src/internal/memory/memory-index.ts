/**
 * Common `MemoryIndex` interface shared between the SQLite-backed
 * `IndexManager` (default) and the Lance-backed adapter (ADR D43, shipped
 * v1.4.0 via lancedb-backend-ship-v1-1 plan).
 *
 * Consumers (`local-agent-memory.ts`, `active-memory.ts`, `tools.ts`,
 * `runActiveMemory`) only ever call `sync()`, `search()`, `status()`,
 * `close()` — the union of those four methods is the portable surface.
 *
 * Why a separate file (vs declaring inline in `index-manager.ts`)? D43
 * promised "extract an abstract `MemoryIndex` interface in
 * `internal/memory/index-interface.ts`". Keeping the contract physically
 * separated from one of its implementations preserves OCP — future
 * backends (Qdrant, PGVector) can land without touching IndexManager.
