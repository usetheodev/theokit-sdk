/**
 * SDK 2.0 Phase 4 (Stage 4) — Optional peer loader for
 * `@theokit/sdk-memory`.
 *
 * The Memory class public API in `src/memory.ts` keeps its surface
 * stable but routes through sdk-memory when installed. When sdk-memory
 * is NOT installed, methods fall back to sdk-core's legacy
 * `internal/memory/*` implementations — preserving v1.x back-compat.
 *
 * Pattern mirrors sdk-handoff's optional-peer dynamic import: try
 * `await import("@theokit/sdk-memory")` once, cache the result (the
 * module OR `null` for "definitively missing"), and let the caller
 * route.
 *
 * Iter 76 (Stage 4 #1): foundation helper for the Memory class
 * delegation refactor. No behavior changes yet — this iter only
 * adds the loader; iter 77+ wires Memory class methods to use it.
 *
 * @internal
