 * - CONSOLIDATABLE (`project`, `session`) — near-duplicate dedup at the similarity threshold.
 *   Overlapping project facts are exactly what a sweep is for.
 * - UNTYPED — EXACT duplicates only. A hand-written bullet under `## Facts` carries no kind,
 *   and the store's own header invites editing those by hand, so untyped is the common case
