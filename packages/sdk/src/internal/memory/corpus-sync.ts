/**
 * The corpus walk: read every markdown file under the memory root, and re-chunk the ones that
 * changed.
 *
 * One of the four concerns that shared `IndexManager`, and the one with the most distinct reason to
 * change — "which files are in the corpus and when is one stale" is a question about the filesystem,
 * not about search or about the schema. It takes a {@link MemoryIndexRepository} rather than a
 * database, so it cannot reach past it into SQL.
 *
 * The staleness test is the content hash, NOT the mtime. mtime is written into `files` for
 * observability; a file touched without being edited must not cost a re-chunk, and a file restored
 * from a backup with an older mtime must not be skipped.
