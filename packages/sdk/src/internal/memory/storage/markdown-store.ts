 *   └── notes/
 *       └── <slug>.md      # hand-written per-topic notes (read by the indexer, never written here)
 *
 * The SDK already emits native Claude Code `.jsonl` sessions, so a consumer can point
 * `local.sessionDir` at `~/.claude` and `--continue` a session its agent wrote. Memory did not hold
 * that line: a fact was a bullet under `## Facts` with its kind in an HTML comment (#389), which
 * that CLI reads as prose. Pointing a memory directory at `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`
 * produced nothing it could open.
 *
 * `## Facts` bullets are still READ. They are already on disk in consumers' repositories, and a
 * format change that stopped reading them would delete what someone recorded — worse than the
 * format it replaces.

 * edge-case review) so concurrent `appendFact` calls within the same process
 * serialize. Multi-process safety is NOT provided.

 * nothing ships the symbol below undocumented and this text invisible.
