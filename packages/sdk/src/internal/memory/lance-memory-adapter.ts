/**
 * `LanceMemoryAdapter` — wraps `LanceIndex` to expose the common
 * `MemoryIndex` interface (sync/search/status/close) so consumers of
 * `IndexManager.open({ backend: "lance" })` get a drop-in replacement
 * for the SQLite-backed `IndexManager`.
 *
 * Semantic deltas vs SQLite (documented so callers know what to expect):
 *
 *  - `sync()` is a NO-OP. Lance is a pure vector store — there is no
 *    markdown corpus to crawl. It returns zero counts with `supported: false`
 *    so the result is not mistaken for a sync that found nothing. Consumers
 *    writing facts hold a `LanceIndex` and call `addFacts` on it; the adapter
 *    does not hand its adaptee out.
 *  - `search()` is HYBRID, not vector-only. Lance supplies the vector distance
 *    and `translateLanceHit` adds a client-side term-overlap ratio (T4.5), so
 *    `textScore` is a real number in 0..1 and `score` is `0.7 * vectorScore +
 *    0.3 * textScore` — never `=== vectorScore`. This block said the opposite
 *    for as long as T4.5 has been shipped, while the docblock 90 lines below
 *    described the change correctly, so the two halves of one file disagreed
 *    and the header is the half a caller reads.
 *  - `status()` reports `backend: "hybrid"` only when an embedding runtime
 *    is wired (always the case for Lance — embedding is required at open).
 *    Both counts are 0 with `countsExact: false`: the port declares `status()`
 *    synchronous and Lance's row count is async, so nothing can be measured
 *    here. The zeros are placeholders and the flag says which.
 *
 * Ships with the lancedb-backend-ship-v1-1 plan (close D12, supersede via
 * D43). v1.4.0 of `@theokit/sdk`.
