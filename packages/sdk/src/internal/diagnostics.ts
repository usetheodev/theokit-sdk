/**
 * The library's single diagnostics channel — silent by default (#147).
 *
 * ## The problem
 *
 * The SDK wrote diagnostics straight to `process.stderr` from hot paths — 92 sites across 51
 * files under `internal/`. In a TUI host (Ink, alternate screen), those writes interleave with the
 * render and **corrupt the frame**. And the host had no way to intercept them: there was no
 * injectable logger. One consumer went as far as installing `proper-lockfile` just to silence ONE
 * of them.
 *
 * A library cannot assume `stdout`/`stderr` are free sinks. The application owns the terminal, not
 * the dependency.
 *
 * ## The contract
 *
 * - **`setDiagnosticsSink(fn)`** hands the messages to the application, which decides where to put
 *   them (a status line, a file, a panel). It is what was missing for a TUI to coexist with the SDK.
 * - **With no sink, nothing is emitted.** A library does not own the host's terminal.
 *
 * ## Silent by default, and how 36 suites survived the flip
 *
 * The default WAS `stderr`, and 36 test files spy on `process.stderr.write` to assert a given
 * warning is emitted. That contract is real and had to survive; migrating all 36 by hand, across
 * four different spy styles, is how you weaken 36 suites in one commit.
 *
 * So the flip happened at the default, and `vitest.setup.ts` installs a sink that FORWARDS to
 * `stderr` for the duration of every test. Those assertions still test what they always tested —
 * "this condition emits a diagnostic" — through the channel a host would use, while production
 * emits nothing unless asked.
 *
 * The cost is stated rather than hidden: no test observes the production default by accident, so
 * `tests/diagnostics-public-entry.test.ts` pins it explicitly by clearing the sink first.
 *
 * ## Coverage is the whole guarantee
 *
 * The first sweep migrated the 92 sites under `internal/` and left `src/`'s own modules —
 * `event-bus.ts`, `batch.ts`, `compaction.ts`, `internal/workflow/step-branch.ts`. A host could
 * therefore install a sink and still have its frame corrupted by a batch run, which is the reported
 * defect with a smaller blast radius. Those are routed here too, and
 * `tests/lint/no-direct-terminal-write.test.ts` is what keeps the next hot path from
 * reintroducing one. "Mostly interceptable" is not interceptable.
 *
 * The remaining direct writers are allowlisted there with a reason, and every one of them is a seam
 * whose destination the CALLER already chooses (`opts.warn`, `opts.logger`, the Workflow logger).
 *
 * ## What this is NOT
 *
 * It is not a logger with levels, formatting or multiple destinations. It is the minimum that
 * resolves the reported blocker; a full logger here would be inventing a requirement nobody asked
 * for.
