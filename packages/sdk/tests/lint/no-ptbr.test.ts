/**
 * Lint test — the codebase is English-only. Bans Portuguese in source and
 * tests: identifiers, comments, JSDoc and string literals alike.
 *
 * Why this is a gate and not a style preference:
 *
 * - JSDoc on an exported symbol is emitted into the published `.d.ts`, so a
 *   Portuguese comment ships to every consumer and shows up on editor hover.
 *   `CLAUDE.md` makes the exported types the canonical public contract; a
 *   contract nobody outside this repo can read is not a contract.
 * - A Portuguese identifier in the public surface is worse still — one shipped
 *   in `@theokit/sdk/compaction` for several releases before this gate existed,
 *   and renaming it was a breaking change. The cost compounds with every
 *   release that carries it.
 * - Test names are executable documentation (`.claude/rules/testing.md` § 3).
 *
 * Detection is two-tier so precision is auditable:
 *
 * - Tier 1 (near-deterministic): Latin letters carrying diacritics that
 *   Portuguese uses and English does not. Loanwords English genuinely borrows
 *   are in `WORD_ALLOWLIST`.
 * - Tier 2 (lexical): unaccented Portuguese words with no English homograph.
 *   Deliberately conservative — short words and cross-language homographs
 *   (`com`, `para`, `mais`, `de`, `os`, `em`, `no`) are NOT listed, because a
 *   false BLOCK on a lint gate is worse than a miss. A Portuguese comment
 *   written entirely without accents can slip past tier 1; tier 2 narrows that
 *   gap without closing it. Stated honestly rather than claimed complete.
 *
 *   `logo` was removed from the lexicon after it flagged `logo.png`: it is a
 *   common English noun as well as Portuguese, and a lexicon entry that fires
 *   on ordinary English is a gate that teaches people to ignore it.

 *
 * - It scanned files CI never sees. `BACKLOG.md` is gitignored (`.gitignore:124`) but sits on disk
 *   in every local checkout; a Portuguese `progress:` note there failed this gate locally while CI
 *   — which never has the file — stayed green. Measured 2026-08-19: `1 failed | 12 passed` locally.
 * - It skipped tracked files CI DOES see. The old walk excluded every directory whose name starts
 *   with `.` (see the retired `isSkippedDir`), which was the right call for `.theokit/memory/
 *   sessions/` (gitignored runtime state, real conversation transcripts, Portuguese because the
 *   user writes Portuguese) but wrongly also hid `.github/`, `.changeset/`, and every other
 *   TRACKED dot-directory. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` carried Portuguese in a comment for as long
 *   as the gate existed, invisible because dot-directories were skipped wholesale.
 *
 * `git ls-files` is exactly the fix for both, for the same reason: it lists what CI receives.
 * Untracked files (including everything gitignored — `.theokit/`, `BACKLOG.md`, `node_modules`,
 * `dist`, `coverage`) are absent by construction, no skip-list needed. Tracked dot-directories are
 * present, no dot-directory carve-out needed. The old `SKIP_DIRS` allowlist and `isSkippedDir`
 * dot-directory rule are gone because `git ls-files` makes both redundant — coverage is exactly
 * "what git tracks", not "what a hand-maintained skip list remembered to exclude".
