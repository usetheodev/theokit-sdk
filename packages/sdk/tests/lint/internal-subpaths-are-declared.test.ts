/**
 * `@theokit/sdk` publishes four `./internal/*` subpaths. That is deliberate:
 * the word `internal` in a specifier is the warning that the surface is
 * semver-exempt, and satellites in this monorepo consume them on that footing.
 *
 * The risk is not the four. It is a fifth appearing because it was convenient,
 * with nobody deciding whether it is a raw channel that also needs a stable
 * facade (`persistence`, `security` have one) or a satellite-only channel that
 * must NOT have one (`memory-adapters`, `memory-store` — a facade there would
 * promise a stability their surface does not have).
 *
 * So this gate does not forbid the escape hatch. It forbids growing it in
 * silence: `src/internal/README.md` names every subpath and its kind, and a new
 * one fails here until someone writes down which kind it is.
 *
 * What it does NOT check: whether the kind recorded is the right one. That is
 * the judgement the gate exists to force someone to make, not to make for them.
