/**
 * #583 — a caller can tell "no tools" from "no tools I declared".
 *
 * `Agent.describe()` reports `(options.tools ?? [])`, so an agent with `tools: []` and an agent that
 * withheld its shell both report `[]` while holding different things. That made the security-relevant
 * question — does this agent have a shell? — unanswerable through the public API.
