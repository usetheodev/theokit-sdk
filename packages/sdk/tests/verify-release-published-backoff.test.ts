/**
 * Tests for the size-proportional backoff in tools/verify-release-published.mjs (#537).
 *
 * The mitigation added in 84624e2d scales the retry backoff by `dist.unpackedSize`, because
 * @theokit/sdk (12.9 MB, 1141 files) propagates slower than the registry's default ~30s window
 * and had produced a false "was NOT published" three releases running.
 *
 * It never engaged. `getUnpackedSize` asked the registry for the size of the version being
 * verified — and it is only ever called for versions the registry has just answered 404 for, so
 * the lookup 404s too, the size is `undefined`, and the default delays are used unchanged.
 * Unreachable by construction: in the loop where it is called it cannot return anything else.
 *
 * Strategy: a fixture workspace (the script reads `packages/` from cwd and takes no arguments)
 * plus an `npm` stub on PATH. Offline and deterministic — the canned answers reproduce exactly
 * what the real registry says mid-publish: 404 for the version being verified, a real size for
 * the package's published `latest`.
