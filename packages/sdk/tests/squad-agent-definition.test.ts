/**
 * M81 T2.2 — `Squad.create` accepts an `AgentDefinition`, not only an already-built `SDKAgent`.
 *
 * ## What actually changed
 *
 * `squad.ts` declared `agents: ReadonlyArray<SDKAgent>`. Assembling a team forced the caller to
 * **materialize each agent by hand** first — resolve the credential, build options, call
 * `Agent.create`, await. That is exactly the work this milestone moves into the framework in its
 * other tasks; leaving it here would be inconsistent.
 *
 * With `discoverSubagents` public (T2.1), the data describing an agent became reachable by the
 * consumer. Accepting that data directly closes the loop: discover -> assemble a team, with no manual step
 * in between.
 *
 * ## The half that matters most is backward compatibility
 *
 * A built `SDKAgent` is still accepted, and so is mixing the two in one list — a real team
 * usually has agents from different origins. A test proving only the new path would pass
 * even if the old one had broken.
