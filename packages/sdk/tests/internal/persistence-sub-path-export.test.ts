/**
 * `@theokit/sdk/internal/persistence` sub-path export smoke test
 * (SDK 2.0 Phase 1 physical Stage 3 prep — iter 32).
 *
 * Per the plan's T1.1 EC-1: sdk-core MUST declare `./internal/persistence`
 * in its `exports` field so extracted packages (sdk-memory, sdk-budget,
 * etc.) can `import` persistence primitives without sdk-core duplication.
 *
 * Without this sub-path, Node ESM blocks consumers with
 * `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.
 *
 * This test pins:
 *   - The sub-path resolves at import time (no module-resolution error).
 *   - The expected primitives are exported (withCwdMutex,
 *     atomicWriteJson, withFileLock, etc.) — these are what Stage 3
 *     source-move requires for sdk-memory's rich impl.
