/*
 * The shared markdown store (#430).
 *
 * `@theokit/sdk-memory` used to carry a full copy of this store, and `Memory.runDreamingSweep`
 * swaps this implementation for the peer's whenever the peer is installed — so the copy that ran
 * was not the copy anyone maintained. It stayed on the pre-#389 layout and stopped finding the
 * files this one writes; the symptom was `factsBefore: 0`, which reads exactly like an empty store.
 *
 * The sub-path below is what lets the satellite import this store instead of copying it, the same
 * remedy theokit#160 applied to the embedding runtime in the same package pair.
 *
 * The barrel spans SEVEN modules now — the corpus walk joined the cluster once the satellite's
 * copy of it was found to skip the per-memory files entirely.
 *
 * (Was: SIX.) Root resolution moved out of the store into `memory-root.ts`
 * (#463), and the session/wiki/transcript cluster joined it once the satellite's byte-identical
 * copies were replaced by re-exports — the same remedy #430 applied to `markdown-store`, extended
 * to the four modules that were still copies. The guarantee below is unchanged: every name the
 * barrel offers is the function itself, from whichever module owns it.
