/**
 * B-156. The precedence at `real-local-run.ts:159-164` is deliberate and its rationale is written
 * beside it: an explicitly-passed API key is ground truth about which endpoint will actually be
 * reached, so a `sk-or-` key must beat an `openai/...` prefix. Nobody is arguing with that.
 *
 * What was missing is the sentence. A caller writing `model: { id: "e2elocal/gpt-4o-mini" }` and
 * receiving `openai API error: auth_failed` had no way to learn their prefix was overruled — the
 * error names only the winner.
 *
 * Measured cost of that silence: a probe, two wrong hypotheses (registration order, then apiMode)
 * and a read of the resolution code, to find out that nothing was broken.
