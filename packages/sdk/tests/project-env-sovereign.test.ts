/**
 * A project's `.env` must not be able to move the credential store or switch off a trust decision.
 *
 * `process.loadEnvFile()` reads the PROJECT's `.env` into `process.env` — which is exactly what you
 * want for a provider key, and exactly what you do not want for the handful of variables that
 * decide where credentials live and what is trusted. A cloned repository is untrusted input; a
 * `.env` in it is untrusted input that the runtime is about to treat as configuration.
 *
 * The scaffolding template this package's sibling ships (`create-theokit`, the TUI surface) calls
 * `process.loadEnvFile()` with no guard at all, so every product scaffolded from it starts exposed.
 * One consumer discovered this and fixed it in ~30 lines of its own; the fix belongs here, where it
 * covers every consumer instead of the one that noticed.
 *
 * The set is NAMED rather than pattern-matched. A convention like "anything ending in _HOME" would
 * quietly change meaning as variables are added, and the point of this list is that adding a
 * sovereign variable is a deliberate act.

/**
 * #410 — a sovereign entry must defend a variable something actually reads.
 *
 * `THEOKIT_DIR_NAME` sat in the list describing itself as naming the project config directory, and
 * nothing ever read it. The entry defended a variable that decided nothing, and its description
 * told a consumer they could point the SDK's config directory elsewhere. Setting it did nothing.
 *
 * This is the gate, and it only works because of a rename that shipped with it. `paths.ts` declared
 * `const THEOKIT_DIR_NAME = ".theokit"` — the same name as the env var — so a search for the
 * variable returned five hits and read as answered. The const is now `THEOKIT_DIR_LITERAL`. Without
 * that rename this assertion would have passed over the defect it exists to catch, which is worth
 * stating plainly: the gate and the rename are one fix, not two.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT: this searches for the KEY as text, so it proves a reference exists, not that the
 * reference does anything. It catches the orphan — an entry nothing anywhere mentions — which is
 * the shape this defect took. A key mentioned only in a dead branch would still pass.
