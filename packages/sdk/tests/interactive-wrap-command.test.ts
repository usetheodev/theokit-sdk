/**
 * M75 T3.2 — `interactiveWrapCommand`: the missing composition.
 *
 * ## Why it exists, and why in the SDK
 *
 * `createSandboxBackend` already does this composition for the **non-interactive** path: it detects bwrap,
 * decides between confining and degrading honestly, and returns a ready backend. The interactive path
 * (PTY) needs exactly the same decision, but delivered as a **wrap function** — because the PTY
 * owns the spawn and only accepts transforming the command (`PtyInteractiveBackend({ wrapCommand })`).
 *
 * Without this function, every consumer wanting a confined interactive shell would rewrite the same
 * sequence: `detectBwrapMemoized` -> `if (!ok) WARN-once` -> `wrapCommandForSandbox` with
 * `allowlistedEnv` and `restrictedSeccompPath`. It is what agent-builder did in 99 lines of
 * subclass, and it is precisely what M75 exists to eliminate — "what every theokit consumer
 * that runs commands will reimplement".
 *
 * ## The invariant these tests protect
 *
 * The two "do not confine" routes are **semantically different** and the code must not merge them:
 * `danger-full-access` is an explicit opt-out (no warning), while bwrap being unavailable is a
 * failure (warns, once). Both return `null` — the value is the same, the meaning is not.
