/**
 * theokit#147 — the sink must be installable from where a CONSUMER stands.
 *
 * The original fix routed 92 internal sites through `diag()` and added a lint gate, and every test
 * it shipped imported `setDiagnosticsSink` from `src/internal/diagnostics.js`. That path is not in
 * the package's `exports` map, so no consumer can reach it: the suite was green while the issue's
 * actual complaint — "a TUI host has no way to intercept these; no injectable logger" — was still
 * true. A channel nobody can install is not a channel.
 *
 * These tests therefore import from the PUBLIC barrel, exactly as a host would, and drive a real
 * SDK path rather than calling `diag()` directly. Importing internals here would reproduce the
 * blind spot this file exists to close.
