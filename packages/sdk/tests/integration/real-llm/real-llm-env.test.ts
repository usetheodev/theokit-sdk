/**
 * The gate that decides whether the real-LLM matrix runs at all.
 *
 * Twenty-two test files call `resolveRealLlmEnv` and pass its `shouldSkip` to `describe.skipIf`.
 * Nothing tested the helper itself, which is the same hole `ollama-probe.test.ts` exists to close
 * one directory over: a gate whose failure direction is "skip" disappears silently. If this
 * function ever returned `shouldSkip: true` unconditionally — a typo, a refactor, an inverted
 * boolean — all twenty-two files would stop running, every suite would stay GREEN, and the only
 * visible trace would be a skipped count nobody reads.
 *
 * So the assertions that matter most here are the ones proving it DOES open (`testing.md` § 4.2):
 * a guard tested only on the inputs it rejects cannot tell a correct predicate from one that
 * rejects everything.
