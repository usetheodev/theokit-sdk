/**
 * issue #47 — OpenRouter reasoning scenario (real-LLM).
 *
 * Env-gated by OPENROUTER_API_KEY. Proves the end-to-end reasoning path the fix exists for:
 * a `thinking` param on `ModelSelection.params` makes the SDK request reasoning from OpenRouter
 * (`reasoning: { effort }`), and the streamed `delta.reasoning` surfaces as `thinking-delta`
 * InteractionUpdates (live, via `onDelta`) plus `thinking` SDKMessages (via `Run.stream`) — on a
 * separate channel from the visible answer.
 *
 * Per `.claude/rules/real-llm-validation.md` this is the committable, repeatable evidence that the
 * unit-tested wiring actually produces reasoning against a real reasoning model (deepseek-r1).
