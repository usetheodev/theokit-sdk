/**
 * What the build actually wired — B-108, and the piece `resolveTrustPosture` was the prerequisite
 * for. A framework cannot report a decision it does not make; now it makes one.
 *
 * The defect this exists to prevent has a name and a history in the consumer that measured it. Three
 * separate items each needed a "what is loaded?" listing, and the obvious implementation for each
 * was to re-read the configuration. Their shared acceptance bullet refuses that, in the same words:
 * the listing comes from what was actually wired, not from re-reading the config file — those two
 * can disagree, and the disagreement is the bug worth catching. One of the three was REOPENED for
 * shipping the re-read.
 *
 * A re-read cannot detect that disagreement by construction, because it IS the config. So this is
 * pure and parameterized: it performs no I/O, which is what makes "no second read" checkable rather
 * than promised — a version that could read a file would need a test proving it did not, and such a
 * test is a promise about the absence of behaviour.
 *
 * Generic by the same test as the floor, the fold and the posture: the capability KEYS and the
 * entity names are the caller's, supplied as data.
