  // THE STATED REASON WAS FALSE AND IS NOW MEASURED. This comment said, in the present tense and in
  // three places in this file, that rollup-plugin-dts "trips on the `types/agent.ts ↔
  // fork-agent.ts` import cycle whenever a sub-entry reaches into `internal/runtime`", surfacing as
  // a spurious "ForkOptions not exported". That cycle does not exist: `src/types/fork-agent.ts` has
  // never existed in this repository (`git log --diff-filter=D` finds no deletion), madge reports
  // zero cycles, and `tests/architecture/type-cycles-closed.test.ts` asserts the same.
  //
  // Tested rather than reasoned about, on 2026-09-01: moving `concurrency` — one of the two entries
  // the comments name as blocked — into `dts.entry` and running `tsup` emitted
  // `dist/concurrency.d.cts` (2.96 KB) with no error. The blocker is not there.
  //
  // THE SPLIT NEVERTHELESS STAYS, for a reason the old comment did not give. `concurrency` is also
  // listed in `tsconfig.tools-dts.json`'s include, so putting it on both paths makes two producers
  // write the same `.d.ts` and the later one wins — a silent double-emit. Moving an entry across
  // therefore means removing it from that include as well, and the two producers do not emit the
  // same SHAPE: rollup-plugin-dts bundles, `tsc` emits file-per-module. That is a change to a
  // published artifact and needs its own verification pass against consumer type resolution, not a
  // config edit made in passing.
  //
  // What is settled: the split is a build-shape decision, NOT a workaround for a type cycle. Anyone
  // revisiting it should start from the double-emit and the shape difference above.

  // With `splitting: false`, esbuild INLINES the shared code into each entry point instead of
  // emit a shared chunk. `TheokitAgentError` ended up duplicated across `errors.js`, `auth/index.js`,
  // `compaction.js`, `subscription/index.js` — distinct classes with the same name. The consequence:
  //
  //     import { TheokitAgentError } from "@theokit/sdk/errors";
  //     import { CredentialError }    from "@theokit/sdk/auth";
  //     new CredentialError("x") instanceof TheokitAgentError  // => FALSE
  //
  // The prototype chain was right; it was the class object that differed. That nullifies the whole
  // premise of a single error hierarchy: a `catch` cannot discriminate a framework error
  // when the error crossed a subpath different from the one used to import the type.
  //
  // M73's parity test predicted exactly this failure mode ("if the build inlines the SDK, the
  // layer exports a COPY and `instanceof` silently becomes false"), but predicted it for the layer;
  // it was already happening here, between the SDK's own subpaths. No unit test caught it — they all
  // import from source, where there is only one class. Only running against the PUBLISHED packages revealed it.
  //
  // Welcome side effect: `dist/index.js` dropped from 207,514 to 20,447 bytes, because what used to be
  // duplicated code became a shared chunk. The 215,000 budget became too loose and deserves to be
  // tightened in a change of its own — lowering it here would mix two decisions.
