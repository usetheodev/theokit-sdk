/**
 * Common `MemoryIndex` interface shared between the SQLite-backed
 * `IndexManager` (default) and the Lance-backed adapter (ADR D43, shipped
 * v1.4.0 via lancedb-backend-ship-v1-1 plan).
 *
 * Consumers (`local-agent-memory.ts`, `active-memory.ts`, `tools.ts`,
 * `runActiveMemory`) only ever call `sync()`, `search()`, `status()`,
 * `close()` — the union of those four methods is the portable surface.
 *
 * Why a separate file (vs declaring inline in `index-manager.ts`)? D43
 * promised "extract an abstract `MemoryIndex` interface in
 * `internal/memory/index-interface.ts`". Keeping the contract physically
 * separated from one of its implementations preserves OCP — future
 * backends (Qdrant, PGVector) can land without touching IndexManager.
 *
 * Iter 50 (Stage 3 source-move #7): hybrid copy from sdk-core's
 * `internal/memory/memory-index.ts`. sdk-core retains its copy for v1.x
 * back-compat; sdk-memory ships the canonical copy that future
 * `index-manager`, `lance-memory-adapter`, and `active-memory` moves
 * will target as siblings.
 *
 * **Iter 50 side-effect:** by publicly re-exporting `MemorySearchHit`
 * via the sdk-memory barrel, this file creates the FIRST reachable
 * downstream consumer for `MemorySearchHit` inside sdk-memory's
 * graph. That unblocks the rollup-plugin-dts treeshake limitation
 * the iter 48 inline-duplicate workaround was guarding against —
 * `internal/active-memory-types.ts` can now re-import the canonical
 * `MemorySearchHit` from `./index-manager-contract.js` and drop its
 * inline mirror. Deletion of that workaround lands in this same iter.
 *

// import these types directly from `./index-manager-contract.js`.
