/**
 * Markdown-first memory storage — re-exported from `@theokit/sdk`, not reimplemented here.
 *
 * This file used to be a full copy (iter 56, Stage 3 source-move #13). The copy went stale: `#389`
 * moved the layout from bullets under `MEMORY.md ## Facts` to a file per memory, and the
 * Claude Code compatibility work added two more read roots — both landed in the SDK's copy and
 * neither in this one. Because `Memory.runDreamingSweep` routes through this package whenever it is
 * installed, **the copy that ran was not the copy anyone had updated**: installing
 * `@theokit/sdk-memory` made every memory the SDK had written unreadable, reported as
 * `factsBefore: 0` — a number that reads exactly like an empty store (#430).
 *
 * theokit#160 fixed the identical shape for the embedding runtime, in this same package pair, by
 * importing one implementation instead of syncing two. Same remedy here. Re-syncing the copy would
 * have fixed today's divergence and left tomorrow's free to happen.
 *
 * The re-exported signatures are supersets of what this package used to expose — the added
 * parameters are optional — so nothing that called them before has to change.
