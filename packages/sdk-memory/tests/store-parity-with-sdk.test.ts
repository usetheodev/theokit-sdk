/**
 * The parity that #430 needed and did not have.
 *
 * `Memory.runDreamingSweep` in `@theokit/sdk` replaces its own store with this package's whenever
 * this package is installed, and its docblock promises the swap is invisible: *"the fallback is not
 * a degraded mode — behaviour and thrown errors match — so consumers do not branch on which path
 * ran."*
 *
 * That promise had no test. It was true when written, the SDK's copy moved to a file per memory
 * (#389) and then gained the Claude Code read roots, this package's copy moved neither, and nothing
 * went red — because every existing test read exactly one of the two copies. **A promise without a
 * test is a claim about the past.**
 *
 * Both halves below are needed and neither implies the other: the behavioural case fails if a
 * reimplementation drifts, and the identity case fails the moment a second implementation exists at
 * all — before it has had time to drift.
