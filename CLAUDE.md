# CLAUDE.md — theokit-sdk

Contract between Claude and the **`@usetheo/sdk`** project (the **Harness** pillar of [usetheo](../CLAUDE.md)). Read this file **and** the root `CLAUDE.md` before editing anything here.

This file complements `/home/paulo/Projetos/usetheo/CLAUDE.md` and `/home/paulo/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Root rules apply unconditionally. SDK-specific rules layer on top.

---

## What this project is

`@usetheo/sdk` is the **TypeScript SDK for the Theo agent harness**. It implements the public contract defined in [`./docs.md`](./docs.md) — `Agent.create()`, `Agent.send()`, `Run.stream()`, MCP servers, hooks, subagents — as a standalone TypeScript package.

The SDK is implemented from scratch, informed by reference projects under `./referencia/` (notably `pi` and the `openai-agents-python` SDK). The reference tree is read-only; we study it, we do not depend on it.

The pillar split (UI · Harness · Skills · Runtime) is locked in the root `CLAUDE.md`. Do not propose copy that drifts from "this is the Harness".

## Source of truth for the public API

[`./docs.md`](./docs.md) is the canonical contract for the public API.

- Any change that affects the public surface (`Agent`, `Run`, `SDKMessage`, `InteractionUpdate`, error types, env vars, config dirs) MUST be reflected in `docs.md` in the same PR.
- The `README.md` is the front door. It summarizes `docs.md` and points to it for deep reference. It does **not** invent API.
- If the implementation drifts from `docs.md`, fix the implementation. If the spec is wrong, propose the change in a separate PR with rationale.

## Locked names

Resolved 2026-05-14. Changing any requires updating `docs.md`, `README.md`, and a `CHANGELOG.md` entry in the same PR.

| Item | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm package | `@usetheo/sdk` | Under the `@usetheo` scope, alongside `@usetheo/ui`. |
| Env var (API key) | `THEOKIT_API_KEY` | All SDK env vars namespace under `THEOKIT_` to leave `THEO_` available for future Theo PaaS tooling. |
| API namespace object | `Theokit` | E.g. `Theokit.me()`, `Theokit.models.list()`, `Theokit.repositories.list()`. |
| Error base class | `TheokitAgentError` | All errors extend this. |
| Local agent ID prefix | `agent-` | Per `docs.md`. |
| Cloud agent ID prefix | `bc-` | Used to auto-detect runtime in `Agent.resume()` / `Agent.get()`. |
| Project config dir | `.theokit/` | `.theokit/mcp.json`, `.theokit/hooks.json`, `.theokit/agents/*.md`, `.theokit/cron/jobs.json`. |
| User config dir | `~/.theokit/` | `~/.theokit/mcp.json`, `~/.theokit/hooks.json`. |
| Pagination cursor field | `nextCursor` | Renamed from the `nextTheo` placeholder in the original `docs.md`. |
| Top-level API namespaces | `Agent`, `Cron`, `Theokit` | Static classes with private constructors. |

> **Naming note.** The agent itself is "the Theo agent" in prose (matches the locked usetheo narrative). The **SDK surface** uses the `Theokit` prefix for consistency with the env var and project name. Two different things — don't collapse them.

## Locked toolchain

Resolved 2026-05-14 with research backing in [the SOTA validation report](#sota-validation-report) (background-agent output captured in the conversation). Changing any of these is a strategic decision, not a refactor.

| Layer | Choice | Version | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Package manager | pnpm | `9.15.0` (via corepack) | Matches sibling `theokit` project; pnpm workspaces are the 2026 standard for TS monorepos. |
| Node runtime | Node | `>=22.12.0` (`.nvmrc` pins minimum) | Node 20 reached EOL April 2026. Use `nvm use` to switch. |
| Build | tsup | `^8.5.0` | Vercel AI ships on tsup. tsdown is the migration path once mature. |
| TypeScript | tsc | `^5.8.0` strict | TS 7 (tsgo) is beta as of April 2026 — do NOT use for emit. |
| Package format | Dual ESM + CJS | — | Stripe / Anthropic SDK / OpenAI SDK still ship dual in 2026. |
| Test | Vitest | `^3.0.0` | Confirmed across MCP SDK, Vercel AI, OpenAI Agents. |
| Lint + format | Biome | `^2.4.0` | Single tool; greenfield choice. ESLint still incumbent in older SDKs. |
| Versioning | Changesets | `^2.31.0` | Standard for pnpm monorepos publishing to npm. |
| Validation | publint + `@arethetypeswrong/cli` | Standard 2026 stack | No credible alternative. |
| Runtime validation | Zod | peer dep `^3.25 \|\| ^4` | Matches Anthropic / OpenAI / Vercel pattern. Optional peer. |
| HTTP | Native `fetch` | — | Anthropic and OpenAI SDKs migrated off `node-fetch`. Expose injectable `fetch` option. |
| Streaming | `AsyncGenerator` of discriminated `SDKMessage` | — | Matches `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. |
| Resource disposal | `dispose()` method + `[Symbol.asyncDispose]` (implementation-side) | — | Skeleton interface uses `dispose()` until lib bump to `ESNext.Disposable`. |

## Voice and Tone

**Locked 2026-05-15.** TheoKit-SDK has adopted the aspirational voice originally scoped to TheoKit. The operational guide — three communication layers (HERO / BODY / DEEP DIVE), vocabulary translation, banned terms list, storytelling rules, before/after examples — lives in [`../theokit/CLAUDE.md`](../theokit/CLAUDE.md). Read it before writing any public copy for this project. This file does not duplicate it.

**Applies to:**

- `README.md` HERO and BODY layers (everything above the `## How it works` delimiter)
- `PITCH.md` — landing-page copy at workspace root
- Future TheoKit-SDK launch material, blog posts, social copy, and site sections referencing the SDK

**Does NOT apply to (stays technical-direct):**

- `docs.md` — the canonical public API contract. Precise, technical, no marketing varnish.
- `README.md` DEEP DIVE layer — everything from `## How it works` downward, including Installation, Authentication, Core concepts, API surfaces (`Agent.create`, `agent.send`, `SDKMessage`), MCP, Cron, Errors, Cloud reference, Configuration reference, Development. Full technical vocabulary is in play.
- This `CLAUDE.md`, ADRs, `CHANGELOG.md`, internal design notes, and per-package docs.

**Cross-project narrative anchors that must hold (regardless of voice):**

- "Harness pillar of usetheo" — the SDK is the harness, not the framework (TheoKit) and not the runtime (Theo PaaS).
- "Open stack underneath" — the load-bearing differentiator. Apache-2.0 SDK, Apache-2.0 local runtime via `pi/`, multi-provider keys, opt-in cloud, walk-away cost zero.
- "Pre-release honesty" — cloud runtime depends on Theo PaaS, currently pre-release. Cloud-only features must be labeled.
- "No invented integration" — never claim wiring with other usetheo pillars that does not yet exist (Cross-Project Rule 2).

If a piece of TheoKit-SDK copy contradicts the locked narrative in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) or the operational rules in [`../theokit/CLAUDE.md`](../theokit/CLAUDE.md), the root and TheoKit rules win — surface the conflict before publishing.

## Pre-release honesty (cloud runtime)

The cloud runtime depends on **Theo PaaS**, currently pre-release per the root `CLAUDE.md` (3.49/4.0).

- `README.md` keeps cloud in a clearly labeled "Cloud runtime — pre-release" section.
- Do **not** promise GA features in copy.
- Local runtime is the primary tested path. Cloud examples document the contract for when PaaS ships.
- If a feature is cloud-only (artifacts, `autoCreatePR`, `envVars`, `git` metadata on results), say so explicitly.
- If a feature is local-only (`local.force`, `local.settingSources`, file-based hooks discovery from `cwd`), say so explicitly.

## Relationship to other pillars

| Pillar | Project | Current integration (verify before claiming) | Roadmap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UI | `@usetheo/ui` | None as of 2026-05-14 | Web chat surfaces may consume `@usetheo/ui` primitives later. |
| Skills | `theokit` | None as of 2026-05-14 | `theokit` README mentions an "agent layer" — that integration lands here. |
| Runtime | Theo PaaS | None (PaaS pre-release) | Cloud runtime endpoint is Theo PaaS. |

> "Do not invent integration that does not exist yet." (Root `CLAUDE.md` rule 2.)
>
> Verify the actual import / dependency before claiming wiring exists in copy or in examples. `grep` first, claim second.

## Working with `referencia/`

`./referencia/` is **read-only study material** for the SDK implementation. It is not part of the pnpm workspace, not imported, and never modified from this project.

Reference projects currently present:

- **`referencia/pi/`** — fork of [`earendil-works/pi`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Primary inspiration for `pi-agent-core` (Agent runtime), `pi-ai` (multi-provider LLM API), and `pi-coding-agent` (CLI patterns).
- **`referencia/cookbook/`** — Pi's example recipes. Useful for understanding intended API ergonomics.
- **`referencia/openai-agents-python/`** — OpenAI Agents Python SDK. Useful for `Agent` / `Run` / streaming API design.

Rules when consulting `referencia/`:

1. **Read, do not run.** Reference projects have their own dependencies, lockfiles, and engines. Do not `npm install` or `pip install` inside `referencia/`. If you need to run them, do so outside this repo.
2. **Never edit.** If you find a bug in a reference project, file it upstream or note it in our `docs.md` rationale. Do not patch.
3. **Cite when borrowing patterns.** When the SDK implementation copies a pattern from a reference, add a code comment: `// referencia: pi/packages/agent/src/foo.ts` so future maintainers can trace the lineage.
4. **No transitive dependencies.** The SDK must not import from `referencia/*`. If you find yourself wanting to, you are wrapping rather than implementing — surface the decision (see Open Decisions).

`biome.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` exclude `referencia/`. Do not change those exclusions silently.

## First-time setup

Node version must be 22.12+. Use nvm:

```bash
nvm use                       # respects .nvmrc → Node 22+
corepack enable               # makes the pinned pnpm available
corepack prepare pnpm@9.15.0 --activate
pnpm install                  # installs workspace deps
pnpm typecheck                # tsc --noEmit across packages
pnpm test                     # vitest
pnpm build                    # tsup → dist/{index,errors}.{js,cjs,d.ts}
pnpm validate                 # everything above plus publint + attw
```

## Open decisions (do not silently choose)

Surface to the user before resolving. Do not commit a silent answer.

| Decision | Status | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Implement vs wrap: the SDK currently stands alone (no `referencia/pi` import). If we decide to internally use `pi-agent-core` as the local-runtime engine, that becomes a workspace-vs-vendored decision. | **Pending** | Determines whether `pi` re-enters the workspace or stays in `referencia/`. |
| Model id catalog: `README.md` examples use `composer-2` (placeholder from `docs.md`). Real catalog comes from `Theokit.models.list()`. | Pending | Affects example accuracy and onboarding. |
| Supported cloud SCM providers at GA (`github`, `gitlab`, `azuredevops`, ...) | Pending | Drives `IntegrationNotConnectedError.provider` values. |
| `Symbol.asyncDispose` in the public `SDKAgent` type: skeleton uses `dispose()` to avoid bumping TS lib to `ESNext.Disposable` before we need it. | Pending | Add when the local runtime ships; coordinate with the `lib` bump in `tsconfig.base.json`. |
| Whether `pnpm validate` should fail on `attw` warnings or just publint errors. | Pending | Affects CI strictness. |
| Local cron scheduler library: `croner` (zero deps, modern) vs `cron` (mature, larger) vs `node-cron` (simple, no timezone). | Pending | Affects bundle size and feature set of local cron runtime. |
| Cron job persistence format: JSON file (current plan: `.theokit/cron/jobs.json`) vs SQLite vs append-only log. | Pending | Affects crash recovery and concurrent-process safety. |
| Memory subsystem: `docs.md` includes `AgentOptions.memory` and `SDKAgent.memory`, but no runtime types or stubs exist yet. Decision: namespace/user/scope keying, local persistence path layout, redaction rules. | Pending | Drives `SDKMemoryManager` shape and `.theokit/memory/` layout. |
| Skills subsystem: `docs.md` includes `AgentOptions.skills`, `SDKAgent.skills`, and `.theokit/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` discovery, but no runtime types or stubs exist yet. Decision: metadata-only public surface, frontmatter schema, parent/subagent inheritance. | Pending | Drives `SDKSkillsManager` shape and skill loader. |

## Inviolable rules (carried from root and global)

1. **95% confidence gate.** Stop and ask if uncertain.
2. **Task completion gate.** Finish the previous task 100% before starting a new one.
3. **Extreme honesty.** Admit ignorance. Surface risks.
4. **Git rules.** No `git checkout` or `git revert`. No direct work on `main`.
5. **TDD.** Tests before production code. Bug fixes start with a regression test.
6. **Changelog discipline.** Every code change updates `CHANGELOG.md` (workspace-level at root; per-package at `packages/<name>/CHANGELOG.md`).
7. **Don't reinvent.** Prefer mature libraries — the toolchain table above already does this.
8. **No emojis** in code, READMEs, or CLAUDE.md files unless explicitly requested.

## Checklist before changing public API

- [ ] Updated `docs.md` to reflect the new shape (it is the source of truth).
- [ ] Updated `README.md` if the change is user-visible.
- [ ] Added or updated tests covering the new contract (TDD: regression test first when fixing a bug).
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `[Unreleased]` in `packages/sdk/CHANGELOG.md` (or root `CHANGELOG.md` for workspace changes).
- [ ] No reference to "Theo IDE" or other surfaces that do not exist in the usetheo stack.
- [ ] No promise of cloud-only features as GA.
- [ ] No silent integration claims with `@usetheo/ui` or `theokit` — verify the import exists.
- [ ] No imports from `referencia/*` — that tree is read-only study material.

## When this file is wrong

The code is authoritative. If this file disagrees with the code, the code wins — update this file via PR with rationale in the commit message. Locked names and locked toolchain require an explicit decision; do not edit them silently.
