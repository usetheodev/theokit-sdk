# Changelog

Workspace-level changes for the `theokit-sdk` monorepo. Per-package changes live in each package's `CHANGELOG.md`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial workspace structure: pnpm workspaces, Biome 2.4, Changesets, tsup 8, Vitest 3, TypeScript 5.8+, Node 22.12+ engines (initial scaffold).
- `@usetheo/sdk` package skeleton at `packages/sdk/` (initial scaffold).
- `pi/packages/*` integrated as workspace children via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (initial scaffold).
- `docs.md` locked as the canonical public API contract (initial scaffold).
- `docs/` folder with human-friendly documentation: getting-started, concepts, guides (cron, MCP, subagents, hooks, errors, resource management), reference, and development guide for contributors (initial scaffold).

### Changed
- License standardized to **Apache-2.0** (was MIT). Aligns all usetheo open-core pillars under a single license — see root `CLAUDE.md` strategic review of 2026-05-14.
- `pi/` and `cookbook/` moved under `referencia/` as read-only reference material; `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `biome.json` updated to exclude `referencia/**` from workspace and lint targets.
